        ================================================
        -- UNDER DEVELOPMENT --
        
        Based on the KGH [template](https://github.com/Knowledge-Graph-Hub/kg-dtm-template/generate). 
        
        To Use
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        ```
          #Clone the repository
          git clone https://github.com/diatomsRcool/eco-kg
          cd eco-kg
          
          #Set up a virtual environment and install the requirements
          python -m venv kg-env
          source kg-env/bin/activate
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          python setup.py install
          
          If the above setup.py install command doesn't work, try:
          
          python -m pipinstall.
          
          #Download the data - Use -o to set a path for the download if you don't like the default
          python run.py download
          
          #Transform the data - Use -o and -i to change the default path if you want
          python run.py transform
          
          #Merge the transformed data into a single KG
          python run.py merge
        ```

        Starting with Planteome - hope to include Monarch Initiative, EOL TraitBank, and more
        
        Currently only contains data from Arabidopsis thaliana, Zea mays, Oryza sativa, Sorghum bicolor, and Populus trichocarpa.
        
        Currently unable to transform PO and TO fully within this workflow. I am also using a modified version of TO with added terms.
        
        Use ROBOT to transform the OWL files to JSON (you need robot for this):
        * Open a new terminal
        * cd to the bin directory in your robot folder
        * Run the code below
        
        ```
        ./robot convert --input path/to.owl --format json --output path/to.json
        ```
        Then, using find and replace in PO and TO json files:
        * Change plant_anatomy to anatomical_entity. 
        * Change plant_structure_development_stage to life_stage. 
        * Change plant_trait_ontology to phenotypic_feature.
        
        Now you can do the transform step.
        
        **Components**
        
        - Download: The [download.yaml](download.yaml) contains all the URLs for the source data.
        - Transform: The [transform_utils](project_name/transform_utils) contains the code relevant to trnsformations of the raw data into nodes and edges (tsv format)
        - Merge: Implementation of the 'merge' function from [KGX](https://github.com/biolink/kgx) using [merge.yaml](merge.yaml) as a source file.
        
        **Utilities**
        
        The code for these are found in the [utils](project_name/utils) folder.
