Support (some) data conversion between `rdflib` and `pyld` Python libraries.

The `rdflib
<http://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/apidocs/>`_
and `PyLD
<https://github.com/digitalbazaar/pyld>`_ libraries use different in-memory data structures so it
is not trivial to use the powerful RDF support of rdflib in conjuction with the JSON-LD processor
implementation of PyLD. This code is designed to provide a bridge between rdflib and PyLD in-memory
formats, avoiding the need to serialize and then re-parse the data.

Requires Python 3.6 or higher because of dependencies.

Limitations
-----------

This code was developed to support a particular application and then pulled out as I needed it a
second time. I haven't thought hard about the general case and am sure that are additional
limitations beyond those I know about. Known limitations:

* assumes the URIRefs in an rdflib graph do not need expansion with a NamespaceManager

History
-------

Last version to work with Python 2.7 was `v0.0.2
<https://github.com/zimeon/rdflib-pyld-compat/releases/tag/v0.0.2>`_, install with
`pip install rdflib-pyld-compat==0.0.2
<https://pypi.org/project/rdflib-pyld-compat/0.0.2/>`_

Contributing
------------

I'd be happy to hear of other problems/limitations and/or suggestions for improvement.
